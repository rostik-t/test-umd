# Getting Started

**EHR Forms** is designed to simplify and speed up development of any kind of applications using openEHR as a foundation. Primary goal is to get rid of openEHR template and archetype complicity when creating UI and to bring as much reusability and versality in the process as possible.

While components to be used in WYSIWYG UI building are loosely coupled with openEHR template, at the same time they are flexible in terms of binding and enriching with any kind of logic and validation.

EHR Forms component libraries already contain enough bricks to build most complicated forms, but it is always possible to develop and add new specific elements needed for the current task.

**EHR Forms** today is:

* More than 10 applications developed and upgraded using EHR Forms;
* More than 500 forms created
* About 30000 clinicians and medical specialists using these forms every day
* More than 50 components to use including 3D and audio recognition
