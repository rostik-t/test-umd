# EHR Forms : Teams \(in detail\)

Each user has a username and password as part of the team. If one person has access to several teams, then in each team he will have his own username and password.  
The team members can only see team's forms, widgets, components, templates, terminology, releases and the list of users.

After entering the login and password, the system checks whether the entered data is suitable for any team:

* If only for one, then the user immediately login into his team;
* If for several, then the user will see the drop-down menu with the list of the teams.

If User has several teams available, then he will be able to switch between them without leaving the system \(both login and password must match\). 

The concept of “super-team” is introduced, Administrator belonging to the super-team is called "super-admin" and can create new teams and have access to any team.
