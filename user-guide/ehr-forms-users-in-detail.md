## Logging into the Users section <a id="Users(indetail)-LoggingintotheUserssection"></a>

The Users section is used for managing user accounts.

To access the Users section, use the URL [http://ehr.solutions/](http://ehr.solutions/)

For the first time log in with the default user name “admin” and the password that you specified for the “admin” account during the installation process.

## Working with User roles <a id="Users(indetail)-WorkingwithUserroles"></a>

Each user **role** is associated with a set of user rights that determine the privileges of users assigned to the **role**.

When you create a new user account, it automatically inherits all the user rights associated with the **role** under which it was created.

All of the configured roles are displayed in the main area of the **Users** section.

Roles can be assigned to individual user accounts, for team work User can use [Teams](ehr-forms-teams-in-detail.md) tab.

_**The pre-configured user roles are:**_

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">User role</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Administrator</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>User that has access to all functionality of the tool. The administration
          account should never be used for day-to-day tasks.</p>
        <p>Instead, it should only be used when you need to access advanced functionality
          (as described in the relevant sections of this manual).</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">User</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Content editors. These users can add, modify and delete content.</td>
