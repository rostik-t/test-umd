# EHR Forms : Checkbox group

A checkbox is a GUI element that permits the user to make a binary choice, i.e. a choice between one of two possible mutually exclusive options. 

For example, the user may have to answer 'yes' \(checked\) or 'no' \(not checked\) on a simple yes/no question. 

Checkbox group represents a group of components that are called [Checkbox](ehr-forms-checkbox.md), united by meaning with label.
