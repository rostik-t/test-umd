# Dropdown list

## Usage <a id="Dropdownlist-Usage"></a>

A drop-down list \(abbreviated drop-down; also known as a drop-down menu, drop menu, pull-down list, picklist\) is a graphical control element, similar to a list box, that allows the user to choose one value from a list. When a drop-down list is inactive, it displays a single value. When activated, it displays \(drops down\) a list of values, from which the user may select one. When the user selects a new value, the control reverts to its inactive state, displaying the selected value.
