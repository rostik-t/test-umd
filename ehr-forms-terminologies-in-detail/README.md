# Terminologies \(in detail\)

The openEHR terminology is an adjunct to the openEHR reference and archetype models, and provides code sets and vocabularies needed by the models which are language independent. It is not a "real-world" ontology of any kind - i.e. it does not contain representation of facts in areas such as diseases or biochemistry - this is the job of much larger terminologies such as ICDx, ICPC and so on.
